# RichStudio
R Shiny app for integrative enrichment analysis and visualization of multiple gene datasets

How to use the app:
1. Visit hosted version on http://hurlab.med.und.edu:3838/RichStudio
2. Clone the repository and running the following in R console:

```R
renv::restore()
devtools::load_all()
RichStudio::launch_RichStudio()
```

In the future, we hope to publish the app as a package.
   
## App Overview:
### Upload files

You can upload either DEG sets or enrichment results to the app from your local machine

File upload automatically guesses element delimiter based on file type, but can also be specified.

Also accepts text input list of significant genes, which can be delimited by any non-alphanumeric character.

Valid input examples:
-	 “Xkr4, Rp1, Sox17,    Mrpl15” 
-	“Xkr4, () Rp1, Sox17,  &* Mrpl15”

Uploaded and created files can be exported as .txt, .csv, and .tsv file format.

Perform gene enrichment from DEG sets or gene lists. 

Supported annotation databases: GO, KEGG, Reactome.

Supported ontologies: BF, MF, CC

20 different supported species (human, mouse, pig, etc.)

Heatmap

### Cluster
Uses Cohen's Kappa (basd on geneID overlap) as a similarity metric between biological terms for use in clustering enriched terms.
